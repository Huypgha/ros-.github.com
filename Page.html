	 I thought that you'd remember, but it seems that you forgot
It's hard for me to blame you when
 you were already lost
Oh, yeah, I'm tired of always
 waiting, oh, yeah, yeah
I see you changed your number,
 that's why you don't get my calls
I gave you all of me, now you don't 
wanna be involved
Oh, yeah, yeah, I really gotta face it
, oh, yeah, yeah
I just wanna be the one
But to you, we're already done
Tell me, why'd you have to hit-and-run me?
Now I'm all alone crying ugly
You broke my heart just for fun
Took my love and just left me numb
Now it's eight in the morning
Hate in the morning (all because of you)
Another story that's sad and true
I can feel the pain, can you?
You had to be the one to let me down
To color me blue
Hate to see you with someone new</p>
